# Edge-Cloud Performance Dashboard for Heart Monitoring App

This project integrates a realistic **EdgeCloudSim** simulation with a web-based dashboard to analyze and visualize the performance of a **time-sensitive healthcare application**‚Äîa smart heart monitoring app.

## ü©∫ Simulation Overview

We used **Sample_App5** from EdgeCloudSim because it is designed to handle **delay-sensitive** scenarios, which are crucial in real-time health applications. The simulation explores decision-making on whether a task should be executed **on the Edge (mobile device)** or **offloaded to the Cloud**, depending on system conditions (load, delay sensitivity, number of users, etc.).

The core objective is to evaluate system behavior when the number of users increases from **100 to 500 patients**. These users represent people using the heart monitoring app simultaneously.

Key questions addressed in the simulation:

- How does service time change as the number of users increases?
- How does the number of failed or delayed tasks evolve?
- Which scheduling policy yields better performance under pressure?

## üß† Orchestrator Policies Compared

The simulation tests multiple **orchestrator policies** to decide execution location:

| Policy         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `RANDOM`       | Randomly selects Edge or Cloud each time |
| `PREDICTIVE`   | Chooses based on system performance/load prediction |
| `GAME_THEORY`  | Optimizes choice for both user and system using game theory |
| `AI_BASED`     | AI-powered decision making using system/historical data |

## üìä Dashboard & Result Visualization

A custom **interactive dashboard** was developed using:

- **Python (Matplotlib, Pandas)**: to extract and process simulation results
- **JavaScript (Chart.js)**: to visualize metrics dynamically per policy

You can view simulation metrics like:
- Average service time
- Failed Tasks Percentage
- Average Processing Time
- Average Network Delay
